# This is not a complete Swagger spec.  It's just a JSON Schema (in YAML format)
# that's referenced by the "users.yaml" spec using "$ref: http://localhost:3000/users.json"
#
# Note that Swagger-Server will automatically convert the YAML to JSON when serving
# the file.  If you prefer to author the file in JSON instead of YAML, then that's ok too.
